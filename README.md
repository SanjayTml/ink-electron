# Ink

Experimental [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) application (using [nextron](https://github.com/saltyshiomix/nextron)) for our "Git for Music" P2P collaboration and tracking platform.

## Usage

Install all dependencies via `npm install` (tried with Node.js 12.4). Run the development server with `npm run dev`, and build packages with `npm run build`. You may need to specify respective packaging targets.

If some errors occur, especially due to native bindings, try to reinstall and rebuild all dependencies via `npm ci`.
